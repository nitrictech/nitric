# Terraform vs. Nitric

<Note>
  Nitric is not designed to replace IaC tools like Terraform but instead
  introduces a method of bringing developer self-service for infrastructure
  directly into the developer application (Nitric's default deployment engines
  are built with Pulumi). Nitric can be augmented through use of tools like
  Pulumi or Terraform and even be fully customized using such tools see [Custom
  Providers](/providers/custom/create) for more details.
</Note>

Nitric is a framework designed to aid developers in building full cloud applications, including infrastructure. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables explicit definition of infrastructure using HCL (or programming languages using [CDKTF](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf)). The main differences between these are:

1. Nitric is cloud-agnostic, code that is written using Nitric constructs can be deployed to any cloud. Terraform supports many clouds, infrastructure declarations are explicitly defined for the provider that a resource is provided by.

2. Nitric defines not only the infrastructure but how it is interacted with at runtime, so infrastructure can be automatically inferred from application code to ensure best practice deployments and least privilege security.

3. Nitric provides tools for locally simulating a cloud environment (using the Nitric CLI), to allow an application to be tested locally. Terraform can be validated and linted as well as contract tested using terraform specific tooling.

## Code Comparison

To showcase the power of the abstraction provided by Nitric here is a showcase of a Nitric program with an equivalent Terraform configuration with application code.

**Nitric**

```javascript title:handle.js
import * as nitric from '@nitric/sdk'

const bucket = nitric.bucket('my-bucket').allow('read', 'write')

bucket.on('create', '*', async (ctx) => {
  console.log(ctx.file.key, 'was created')
})
```

**Terraform**

```javascript title:src/index.js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk')

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const {
    s3: { object },
  } = event
  console.log(object.key, 'was created')

<Note>
  In the Terraform example we get control over absolutely every facet of our
  infrastructure which is great, but for the majority of use cases, a repeatable
  pattern of deployment is enough and scales much better than applying
  fine-grained configuration every time we need to define a new deployment.
