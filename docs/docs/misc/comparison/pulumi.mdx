# Pulumi vs. Nitric

<Note>
  Nitric is not designed to replace IaC tools like Pulumi, but instead
  introduces a method of bringing developer self service for infrastructure
  directly into the developer application (Nitric's default deployment engines
  are built with Pulumi). Nitric can be augmented through use of tools like
  Pulumi and even be fully customized using such tools see [Custom
  Providers](/providers/custom/create) for more details
</Note>

Nitric is a framework designed to aid developers in building full cloud applications, including declaring their infrastructure and application code in one place. Pulumi is an Infrastructure as Code tool that enables developers to define infrastructure using traditional programming languages or YAML (Cuelang). The main differences between these are:

1. Nitric is cloud-agnostic, code that is written using Nitric constructs can be deployed to any cloud. Pulumi supports many clouds, infrastructure declarations are explicitly defined for the provider that a resource is provided by.

1. Nitric defines not only the infrastructure but how it is interacted with at runtime, so infrastructure can be automatically inferred from application code to ensure best practice deployments and least privilege security.

1. Nitric uses Pulumi under the hood for the Out of the Box providers. Pulumi is a great option for extending infrastructure deployed by Nitric or for deploying Nitric applications to clouds not supported by Nitric by default.

1. Nitric provides tools for locally simulating a cloud environment (using the Nitric CLI), to allow applications to be tested locally. Pulumi programs can be unit tested but applications written to be deployed will need a separate solution for local development such as LocalStack.

# Side by Side

To showcase the power of the abstraction provided by Nitric here is a showcase of a Nitric program with an equivalent Pulumi program with application code.

**Nitric**

```javascript title:handle.js
import * as nitric from '@nitric/sdk'

const bucket = nitric.bucket('my-bucket').allow('read', 'write')

bucket.on('create', '*', async (ctx) => {
  console.log(ctx.file.key, 'was created')
})
```

**Pulumi**

```javascript title:src/index.js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk')

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const {
    s3: { object },
  } = event
  console.log(object.key, 'was created')

<Note>
  In the pulumi example we get control over absolutely every facet of our
  infrastructure which is great, but for the majority of use cases a repeatable
  pattern of deployment is enough and scales much better than applying fine
  grained configuration every time we need to define a new deployment (with
  Pulumi this would typically be done by sharing infrastructure as libraries
  e.g. Pulumi Crosswalks).

The below table contains the main differences that you can see in the code examples, and also some that cannot fit in such a small app, but we still would like you to know about :)
