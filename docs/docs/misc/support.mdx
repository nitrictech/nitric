## Bug Reports

You can help us improve Nitric by creating **bug reports**. When creating a bug report, it's important that you include as much information as possible about your issue. That way, it's easier to reproduce and fix the issue.

<Note>
  You can also create **feature requests** or ask a **question** via the [issue
  templates](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.
</Note>

## Where do I open the bug report?

The Nitric framework has many different repositories in the [nitrictech](https://github.com/nitrictech) organization on GitHub. If you have an issue with any component, you can open a new issue in the respective repo.

If you're unsure where to open the GitHub issue, you can use our main [nitrictech/nitric](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric) repo and our [bug report issue template](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=1.bug.md). The Nitric team frequently monitors and triages new issues within this main repo and will move the issue to another repo if required.

## Share reproduction of bugs

To best help with understanding the issue effectively, provide a **standalone GitHub repository** in your report that can reproduce the issue.

For information on how to create minimal, reproducible examples you can view this informative [Stackoverflow guide](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).

## Best practices for writing the bug report

If you don't have time to create a standalone repository, please include as much information as you can about the issue, use the [Bug report template](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=1.bug.md) from our main repo to help guide you.

### Include .nitric log files

Log files can be found in your stack directory under the `.nitric` folder.
Including Log files will provide a ton of useful information logged during local run and cloud deployments.

### Include bug description and reproduction

When describing the bug, it helps to provide the following information:

- A clear and concise description of what the bug is
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
- Screenshots (if applicable)

### Include environment and setup information

Any information about your environment and setup will be important to help reproduce the bug. Please include the following:

- Which version of the **Nitric CLI** you are using (run `nitric version` to see your version)
- Your **Operating System**
- Any nitric dependencies and their versions, such as SDKs or Middleware
- Which cloud providers you are deploying to and their version (found in your stack file)

### Example Report

#### Describe the bug:

Returning a JSON response in my list handler doesn't work, it returns nothing and times out.

#### Steps to reproduce:

I created a simple function handler to set the response body to a JSON string.

```typescript
import { api } from '@nitric/sdk'

api('public').get('/customers', (ctx) => {
  // construct response for the GET: /customers request
  const responseBody = {}
  ctx.res.json(responseBody)
})
```

Then I run `nitric start` to run nitric locally.

#### What I expected:

I expected to see a 200 status with the JSON response printed to my terminal in a readable format or at least an error explaining what I did wrong.

#### What I received:

I then use curl to test the handler's endpoint.

```bash
curl http://localhost:4001/customers
```

I did not receive a response from the server.

#### Environment and setup information:

- Nitric CLI version: `Nitric Helper CLI v2.0`
- Dependencies used: `@nitric/sdk@1.0.0`
- Cloud providers: AWS and Google Cloud
