# Building a REST API with Nitric and Deno

This guide will show you how to build a serverless REST API with the Nitric framework using [Deno](https://deno.com/). The example API enables getting, setting, and editing basic user profile information using a Nitric [key value store](/keyvalue) to store user data. Once the API is created, we'll test it locally, then optionally deploy it to a cloud provider of your choice.

The API will provide the following routes:

| **Method** | **Route**      | **Description**                  |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `GET`      | /profiles/[id] | Get a specific profile by its Id |
| `POST`     | /profiles      | Create a new profile             |
| `DELETE`   | /profiles/[id] | Delete a profile                 |

There is also an extended section of the guide that adds file operations using a Nitric [bucket](/storage) to store and retrieve profile pictures. The extension adds these routes to the API:

| **Method** | **Route**                     | **Description**                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `GET`      | /profiles/[id]/image/upload   | Get a profile image upload URL    |
| `GET`      | /profiles/[id]/image/download | Get a profile image download URL  |
| `GET`      | /profiles/[id]/image/view     | View the image that is downloaded |

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/)
- [Nitric CLI](https://nitric.io/docs/installation)
- A supported code editor like VS Code with the [Deno extension](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/vscode/) installed.
- _(optional)_ Your choice of an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) account

## Getting started

Let's start by creating a new project from a Nitric TypeScript template, this will provide a base to start building the API.

```bash
nitric new my-profile-api ts-starter-deno
```

Next, open the project in your editor of choice.

```bash
cd my-profile-api
```

Make sure all dependencies are resolved:

```bash
deno install
```

The scaffolded project should have the following structure:

```text
services/
├── api.ts
node_modules/
deno.dockerfile
deno.dockerfile.dockerignore
deno.json
package.json
nitric.yaml
README.md
```

You can test the project to verify everything is working as expected:

```bash
nitric start
```

If everything's working you can now delete all files in the `services/` folder, we'll create new services in this guide.

## Building the API

This example uses UUIDs to create unique IDs to store profiles against, let's start by adding a library to help with that:

```bash
deno install npm:uuid
```

Applications built with Nitric can contain many APIs, let's start by adding one to this project to serve as the public endpoint. Create a file named `profiles.ts` in the services directory and add the following code to that file.

```typescript title:services/profiles.ts
import { api, kv } from 'npm:@nitric/sdk'
import { v4 as uuid } from 'npm:uuid'

// Define a profile interface
interface Profile {
  id: string
  name: string
  age: number
  homeTown: string
}

// Create an API named 'public'
const profileApi = api('public')

// Define a key value store named 'profiles', then request get, set and delete permissions
const profiles = kv<Profile>('profiles').allow('get', 'set', 'delete')
```

Here we're creating an API named `public` and key value store named `profiles`, then requesting get and set permissions which allows our function to access the key value store.

<Note>
  Resources in Nitric like `api` and `key value store` represent high-level
  cloud resources. When your app is deployed Nitric automatically converts these
  requests into appropriate resources for the specific [provider](/providers).
  Nitric also takes care of adding the IAM roles, policies, etc. that grant the
  requested access. For example the `key value store` resource uses DynamoDB in
  AWS or FireStore on Google Cloud.
</Note>

### Create profiles with POST

Next we will add features that allow our API consumers to work with profile data.

<Note>
  You could separate some or all of these handlers into their own files if you
  prefer. For simplicity we'll group them together in this guide.
</Note>

```typescript title:services/profiles.ts
profileApi.post('/profiles', async (ctx) => {
  const id = uuid()
  const { name, age, homeTown } = ctx.req.json()

  try {
    // Create a new profile
    await profiles.set(id, {
      id,
      name,
      age,
      homeTown,
    })

    // Set a JSON HTTP response
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Profile with id ${id} created.`,
    })
  } catch (error) {
    ctx.res.status = 500
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Failed to create profile.`,
    })
  }
})
```

### Retrieve a profile with GET

```typescript title:services/profiles.ts
profileApi.get('/profiles/:id', async (ctx) => {
  const { id } = ctx.req.params

  try {
    // Get a profile by id
    const profile = await profiles.get(id)

    // Set a JSON HTTP response
    ctx.res.json(profile)
  } catch (error) {
    ctx.res.status = 404
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Profile with id ${id} not found.`,
    })
  }
})
```

### Remove a profile with DELETE

```typescript title:services/profiles.ts
profileApi.delete('/profiles/:id', async (ctx) => {
  const { id } = ctx.req.params

  try {
    // Delete a profile by id
    await profiles.delete(id)

    // Set a JSON HTTP response
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Profile with id ${id} deleted.`,
    })
  } catch (error) {
    ctx.res.status = 404
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Profile with id ${id} not found.`,
    })
  }
})
```

### List all profiles with GET

```typescript title:services/profiles.ts
profileApi.get('/profiles', async (ctx) => {
  try {
    const profilesList = []
    // Get a profile by id
    const keys = profiles.keys()

    for await (const key of keys) {
      const profile = await profiles.get(key)
      profilesList.push(profile)
    }

    // Set a JSON HTTP response
    ctx.res.json(profilesList)
  } catch (error) {
    ctx.res.status = 404
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Profiles not found.`,
    })
  }
})
```

## Ok, let's run this thing!

Now that you have an API defined with handlers for each of its methods, it's time to test it locally.

```bash
nitric start
```

Once it starts, your services will receive requests via the API port. You can use the Local Dashboard or any HTTP client to test the API. We'll keep it running for our tests.

## Test the API

Below are some example requests you can use to test the API. You'll need to update all values in brackets `[]` and change the URL to your deployed URL if you're testing on the cloud.

### Create Profile

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:4001/profiles' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "Peter Parker",
    "age": "21",
    "homeTown" : "Queens"
}'
```

### Fetch Profile

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]'
```

### Fetch All Profiles

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles'
```

### Delete Profile

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]'
```

## Deploy to the cloud

At this point, you can deploy the application to any supported cloud provider. Start by setting up your credentials and any configuration for the cloud you prefer:

- [AWS](/providers/pulumi/aws)
- [Azure](/providers/pulumi/azure)
- [Google Cloud](/providers/pulumi/gcp)

Next, we'll need to create a `stack`. Stacks represent deployed instances of an application, including the target provider and other details such as the deployment region. You'll usually define separate stacks for each environment such as development, testing and production.

```bash
nitric stack new dev
```

Continue by checking your stack file `nitric.dev.yaml` and adding in your preferred region, let's use `us-east-1`.

```yaml title:nitric.dev.yaml
# The nitric provider to use
provider: nitric/aws@latest
# The target aws region to deploy to
# See available regions:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lambda-service.html
region: us-east-1
```

<Note>
  Cloud deployments incur costs and while most of these resource are available
  with free tier pricing you should consider the costs of the deployment.
</Note>

We can deploy our application using the following command:

```bash
nitric up
```

When the deployment is complete, go to the relevant cloud console and you'll be able to see and interact with your API. If you'd like to make changes to the API you can apply those changes by re-running the `up` command. Nitric will automatically detect what's changed and just update the relevant cloud resources.

When you're done testing your application you can tear it down from the cloud, use the `down` command:

```bash
nitric down
```

## Optional - Add profile image upload/download support

If you want to go a bit deeper and create some other resources with Nitric, why not add images to your profiles API.

### Access profile buckets with permissions

Define a bucket named `profilesImg` with reading/writing permissions.

```typescript title:services/profiles.ts
import { bucket } from 'npm:@nitric/sdk'

const profilesImg = bucket('profilesImg').allow('read', 'write')
```

### Get a URL to upload a profile image

```typescript title:services/profiles.ts
profileApi.get('/profiles/:id/image/upload', async (ctx) => {
  const { id } = ctx.req.params

  // Return a signed upload URL, which provides temporary access to upload a file.
  const photoUrl = await profilesImg
    .file(`images/${id}/photo.png`)
    .getUploadUrl()

  ctx.res.json({
    url: photoUrl,
  })
})
```

### Get a URL to download a profile image

```typescript title:services/profiles.ts
profileApi.get('/profiles/:id/image/download', async (ctx) => {
  const { id } = ctx.req.params

  // Return a signed download URL, which provides temporary access to download a file.
  const photoUrl = await profilesImg
    .file(`images/${id}/photo.png`)
    .getDownloadUrl()

  ctx.res.json({
    url: photoUrl,
  })
})
```

You can also return a redirect response that takes the HTTP client directly to the photo URL.

```typescript title:services/profiles.ts
profileApi.get('/profiles/:id/image/view', async (ctx) => {
  const { id } = ctx.req.params

  // Redirect to a signed read-only file URL.
  const photoUrl = await profilesImg
    .file(`images/${id}/photo.png`)
    .getDownloadUrl()

  ctx.res.status = 303
  ctx.res.headers['Location'] = [photoUrl]
})
```

### Test the extended API

Update all values in brackets `[]` and change the URL to your deployed URL if you're testing on the cloud.

#### Get an image upload URL

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]/image/upload'
```

#### Using the upload URL with curl

```bash
curl --location --request PUT '[url]' \
--header 'content-type: image/png' \
--data-binary '@/home/user/Pictures/photo.png'
```

#### Get an image download URL

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]/image/download'
```
