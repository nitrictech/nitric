# Deployment Automation with GitHub Actions and Nitric

This guide will demonstrate how Nitric can be used, along with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), to create a continuous deployment pipeline. We provide examples for deploying to AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, which you can adapt based on your preferred cloud provider.

<Note>
  This guide assumes basic knowledge about GitHub Actions. If you're new to the
  feature you could start by reviewing [GitHub's
  docs](https://github.com/features/actions)
</Note>

## Configuration

1. **Prepare Your Nitric Project**<br />
   Ensure you have a Nitric project ready to deploy. If you haven‚Äôt set up a project yet, refer to our [quickstart guide](/get-started/quickstart).

2. **Add a GitHub Actions Workflow File**<br />
   Create a YAML file in a `.github/workflows/` folder at the root of your project to configure the deployment automation steps. You can name the file according to your preference; for our examples, we use `deploy-aws.yaml`, `deploy-azure.yaml`, and `deploy-gcp.yaml`.

Here‚Äôs example content for each cloud provider:
