# HTTP

Nitric supports existing web app and API frameworks, including Express, Koa, Fastify and many more. The `http` resource allows you to connect Nitric to your existing applications. When deployed, this resource deploys a unique HTTP API Gateway in your chosen cloud provider and routes all incoming requests to your HTTP application.

<Note>
  The HTTP resource is currently only supported for Node.js projects. If you
  would like support for another language let us know:

## Connecting existing frameworks

Here are some examples of how to connect your existing API frameworks with Nitric:

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Express.js">

```javascript
import { http } from '@nitric/sdk'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()

app.use('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.send('hello from express')
})

http(app)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="NestJS">

```javascript
import { http } from '@nitric/sdk'
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core'
import { AppModule } from './app.module'

async function bootstrap(port: number) {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule)
  return await app.listen(port)
}

http(bootstrap)
```

</TabItem>
