# Nitric\'s Node.js SDK

This SDK reference provides documentation for the services and methods in Nitric\'s Node.js library for JavaScript and TypeScript.

The library provides the ability to define and interact with cloud resources, as well as build application services.

## Installation

If you used a Nitric starter template for JavaScript or TypeScript to scaffold your project, then `@nitric/sdk` will already be included in the dependencies in your `package.json` file. Using starter templates is the recommended installation option since it ensures the other files and configuration needed are also set up.

However, you can also install the SDK from NPM.

### Using NPM

```bash
npm install @nitric/sdk
```

### Using Yarn

```bash
yarn add @nitric/sdk
```

## Source

The source for the SDK is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nitrictech/node-sdk).
