# Node.js - bucket.on()

Create a new bucket notification trigger when certain files are created or deleted.

```javascript
import { bucket } from '@nitric/sdk'

const assets = bucket('assets')

const accessibleAssets = bucket('assets').for('reading')

// The request will contain the name of the file `key` and the type of event `type`
assets.on('delete', '*', (ctx) => {
  console.log(`A file named ${ctx.req.key} was deleted`)
})

assets.on('write', '/images/cat', (ctx) => {
  console.log('A cat image was written')
})

// If `on` is called with a permissioned bucket, a file will also be provided with the request
accessibleAssets.on('write', '/images/dog', async (ctx) => {
  const dogImage = await ctx.req.file.read()

  console.log(dogImage)
})
```
