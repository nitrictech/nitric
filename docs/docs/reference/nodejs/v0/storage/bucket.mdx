# Node.js - bucket()

Create a new bucket for storing and retrieving files.

```javascript
import { bucket } from '@nitric/sdk'

// Create a readable/writable reference to an 'assets' bucket
const assets = bucket('assets').for('reading', 'writing', 'deleting')
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  <Property name="name" required type="string">
    The unique name of this bucket within the app. Subsequent calls to `bucket`
    with the same name will return the same object.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Access

All Nitric resources provide access permissions you can use to specify the level of access your code needs to the resource. See here for details about infrastructure [security](/get-started/foundations/infrastructure/security).

### Available permissions:

---

**reading**

This permission allows your function to read files from the bucket

---

**writing**

This permission allows your function to write files to the bucket

---

**deleting**

This permission allows your function to delete files from the bucket

---

## Working with files

See the following for examples on working with files in a bucket:

- [on()](./bucket-on)
- [file()](./bucket-file)
- [file().read()](./bucket-file-read)
- [file().write()](./bucket-file-write)
- [file().delete()](./bucket-file-delete)
- [file.getDownloadUrl()](./bucket-file-downloadurl)
- [file.getUploadUrl()](./bucket-file-uploadurl)
