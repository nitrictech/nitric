# Nitric's .NET SDK

This SDK reference provides documentation for the functions and methods in Nitric's .NET library for C# and .NET.

The library provides the ability to define and interact with cloud resources, as well as build application logic like functions/handlers.

## Installation

If you used a Nitric starter template for C# to scaffold your project, then `Nitric.Sdk` will already be included in the dependencies. Using starter templates is the recommended installation option since it ensures the other files and configuration needed are also set up.

However, you can also install the SDK from Nuget.

### Using dotnet CLI

```bash
dotnet add package Nitric.Sdk
```

## Source

The source for the SDK is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nitrictech/dotnet-sdk).
