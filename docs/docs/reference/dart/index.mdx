# Nitric\'s Dart SDK

This SDK reference provides documentation for the services and methods in Nitric\'s Dart library.

The library provides the ability to define and interact with cloud resources, as well as build application services.

<Note>
  This is reference documentation for the Nitric Dart SDK. If you're just
  learning Nitric, we recommend starting with the
  [Quickstart](/get-started/quickstart) guide.
</Note>

## Installation

If you used a Nitric starter template for Dart to scaffold your project, then `nitric_sdk` will already be included in the dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file. Using starter templates is the recommended installation option since it ensures the other files and configuration needed are also set up.

However, you can also install the SDK from `pub.dev`.

```
dart pub add nitric_sdk
```

## Source

The source for the SDK is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nitrictech/dart-sdk) or [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/nitric_sdk).
