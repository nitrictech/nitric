# Dart - bucket()

<Note>
  This is reference documentation for the Nitric Dart SDK. To learn about
  Storage and Buckets in Nitric start with the [Storage docs](/storage).
</Note>

Create a new bucket for storing and retrieving files.

```dart
import 'package:nitric_sdk/nitric.dart';

// Create a readable, writable, and deletable reference to an 'assets' bucket
final assets = Nitric.bucket("assets").allow([
  BucketPermission.read,
  BucketPermission.write,
  BucketPermission.delete,
]);
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  <Property name="name" required type="String">
    The unique name of this bucket within the service. Subsequent calls to
    `bucket` with the same name will return the same object.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Access

All Nitric resources provide access permissions you can use to specify the level of access your service needs to the resource. See here for details about infrastructure [security](/get-started/foundations/infrastructure/security).

### Available permissions:

---

**BucketPermission.read**

This permission allows your service to read files from the bucket

---

**BucketPermission.write**

This permission allows your service to write files to the bucket

---

**BucketPermission.delete**

This permission allows your service to delete files from the bucket

---

## Working with files

See the following for examples on working with files in a bucket:

- [on()](./bucket-on)
- [file()](./bucket-file)
- [file().read()](./bucket-file-read)
- [file().write()](./bucket-file-write)
- [file().delete()](./bucket-file-delete)
- [file.getDownloadUrl()](./bucket-file-downloadurl)
- [file.getUploadUrl()](./bucket-file-uploadurl)
