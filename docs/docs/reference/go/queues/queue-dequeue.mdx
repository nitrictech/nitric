# Go - Queue.Dequeue()

<Note>
  This is reference documentation for the Nitric Go SDK. To learn about Queues
  in Nitric start with the [Async Messaging docs](/messaging#queues).
</Note>

Dequeue messages.

```go
import (
  "context"
  "fmt"

  "github.com/nitrictech/go-sdk/nitric"
  "github.com/nitrictech/go-sdk/nitric/queues"
)

func main() {
  queue := nitric.NewQueue("queue-name").Allow(queues.QueueDequeue)

  ctx := context.TODO()

  // dequeue up to 10 messages
  messages, err := queue.Dequeue(ctx, 10)
  if err != nil {
    return
  }

  for _, message := range messages {
    fmt.Println("Message: ", message.Message())

    message.Complete(ctx)
  }

  nitric.Run()
}
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  <Property name="ctx" required type="context">
    The context of the call, used for tracing.
  </Property>
  <Property name="depth" type="int">
    The maximum number of messages to dequeue. Defaults to 1.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Notes

### Completing dequeued items

Since the process is asynchronous the queue doesn't know when a message has been processed. This ensures failed services/containers don't result in lost message, since messages are not removed from a queue when they're dequeued.

Instead, messages are hidden and requesters are granted a temporary lease for each message they request.

When processing is complete, the requester must tell the queue the task was completed successfully, which will remove it from the queue and stop it being reprocessed.

<Note>
  Failing to complete a dequeued message before the lease expires will result in
  it being re-queued.
</Note>

To notify the queue that a message was completed call the `Complete()` method on the dequeued message reference.

### Dequeue depth

When calling `Dequeue()` a depth parameter can be provided, e.g. `Dequeue(ctx, 5)`. This will _attempt_ to dequeue up to 5 messages from the queue.

However, if the queue is empty or less than 5 messages are available on the queue, then the maximum that are currently available will be returned.

This means calls to dequeue will return between 0 and _depth_ tasks.

## Examples

### Dequeue and complete messages

```go
import (
  "context"
  "fmt"

  "github.com/nitrictech/go-sdk/nitric"
  "github.com/nitrictech/go-sdk/nitric/queues"
)

func main() {
  queue := nitric.NewQueue("queue-name").Allow(queues.QueueDequeue)

  ctx := context.TODO()

  // dequeue up to 10 messages
  messages, err := queue.Dequeue(ctx, 10)
  if err != nil {
    return
  }

  for _, message := range messages {
    fmt.Println("Message: ", message.Message())

    message.Complete(ctx)
  }

  nitric.Run()
}
```
