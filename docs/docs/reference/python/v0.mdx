# Nitric\'s Python SDK

This SDK reference provides documentation for the services and methods in Nitric\'s library for Python.

The library provides the ability to define and interact with cloud resources, as well as build application logic like services/handlers.

## Installation

If you used a Nitric starter template for Python to scaffold your project, then `nitric` will already be included in the dependencies in your `Pipfile`. Using starter templates is the recommended installation option since it ensures the other files and configuration needed are also set up.

### Using Pipenv

```bash
pipenv install nitric
```

## Source

The source for the SDK is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nitrictech/python-sdk).
