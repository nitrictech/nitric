# Python - bucket()

<Note>
  This is reference documentation for the Nitric Python SDK. To learn about
  Buckets and Storage in Nitric start with the [Storage docs](/storage).
</Note>

Create a new bucket for storing and retrieving files.

```python
from nitric.resources import bucket
from nitric.application import Nitric

assets = bucket('assets').allow('read', 'write', 'delete')

Nitric.run()
```

> Earlier versions of the Nitric SDK used 'reading', 'writing' and 'deleting'. The latest version uses 'read', 'write' and 'delete'.

## Parameters

<Properties>
  <Property name="name" type="string" required>
    The unique name of this bucket within the app. Subsequent calls to `bucket`
    with the same name will return the same object.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Access

All Nitric resources provide access permissions you can use to specify the level of access your service needs to the resource. See here for details about infrastructure [security](/get-started/foundations/infrastructure/security).

### Available permissions:

---

**reading**

This permission allows your function to read files from the bucket

---

**writing**

This permission allows your function to write files to the bucket

---

**deleting**

This permission allows your function to delete files from the bucket

## Working with files

See the following for examples on working with files in a bucket:

- [on()](./bucket-on)
- [file()](./bucket-file)
- [file.read()](./bucket-file-read)
- [file.write()](./bucket-file-write)
- [file.delete()](./bucket-file-delete)
- [file.download_url()](./bucket-file-downloadurl)
- [file.upload_url()](./bucket-file-uploadurl)
