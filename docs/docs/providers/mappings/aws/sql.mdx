# AWS Resources - SQL Database

Nitric SQL Databases are deployed to AWS using [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds).

## AWS Resources

The following resources are created when deploying SQL Databases to AWS:

- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Security Group
- Aurora PostgreSQL Cluster
- Cluster Instance
- Subnet Group
- CodeBuild Project for migrations

## Deployment

During deployment the Nitric CLI deploys your SQL Databases:

- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Subnets are created
- Declared databases are deployed as Aurora PostgreSQL Clusters
- Creates new Subnet Groups for the Aurora PostgreSQL Cluster
- Appropriate IAM policies are setup enabling VPC access to the database
- Migration images are built and pushed to the [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) as private images
- CodeBuild projects are created to run migrations on the database

## Other Engine Support

Currently, Nitric supports only PostgreSQL for AWS RDS databases. Support for other engines like MySQL is not available yet, but you can create a [custom provider](/providers/custom) to add support for your preferred database engine.

If you'd like to see support for additional engines, please share your [feedback](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/issues/684) with the Nitric team!
