# AWS Resources - Batch

Nitric Batch Jobs are deployed to AWS using [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/).

## AWS Resources

The following resources are created when deploying Batch Jobs to AWS:

- AWS Batch Compute Environments
- AWS Batch Job Queues
- AWS Batch Job Definitions
- EC2 Instances
- EC2 Security Groups
- ECR Images
- IAM Policies

## Deployment

During deployment the Nitric CLI deploys your batch jobs:

- Built container images are pushed to the [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) as private images
- Files referenced by the `batch-services` key in the `nitric.yaml` file are built into Job Definitions
- IAM roles and policies are created
- AWS Batch Compute Environments are created
- AWS Batch Job Queues are created
