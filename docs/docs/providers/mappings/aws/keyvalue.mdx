# AWS Resources - Key Value Store

Nitric KV Stores are deployed to AWS using [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb).

## AWS Resources

Each Nitric Key Value Store will result in the creation of a DynamoDB Table.

## Deployment

During deployment the Nitric CLI deploys your key/value stores:

- Declared stores are deployed as DynamoDB tables
- Appropriate partition and sort keys are set on the table to enable setting and retrieval features
- IAM policies are setup enabling declared access by your Lambda Functions
