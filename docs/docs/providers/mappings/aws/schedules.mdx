# AWS Resources - Schedules

Nitric Schedules are deployed to AWS using [CloudWatch Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html).

## AWS Resources

The following resources are created when deploying to Schedules to AWS:

- CloudWatch Event Rules
- CloudWatch Event Targets
- SNS Topics
- SNS Subscriptions
- Lambda Functions for Subscribers

## Deployment

To maximize consistency between cloud providers, Schedules are implemented by Nitric in AWS using SNS Topics. The Nitric CLI builds subscribers and deploys schedules:

- SNS Topics are created for each schedule
- CloudWatch Rules with cron expressions that match the schedule definitions are created
- SNS topics are setup as targets for the events created by rules
- AWS Lambda Functions are created which will run the scheduled code
- The Lambda Functions are setup as subscribers to the SNS topics
- IAM policies are setup enabling lambdas to be triggered by topics and CloudWatch to publish events
