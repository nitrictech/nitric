# AWS Resources - Secrets

Nitric Secrets are implemented in AWS using [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).

## AWS Resources

- Secrets Manager Secrets (at runtime)
- IAM Policies

## Deployment

AWS Secrets Manager is a service offered by AWS, there are no instances to deploy. As a result, the Nitric CLI only ensures the appropriate IAM policies and roles are in place to allow your Lambda Functions to access and store secrets.
