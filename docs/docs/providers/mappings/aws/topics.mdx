# AWS Resources - Topics

Nitric Topics and Events are deployed to AWS using [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/).

## AWS Resources

- SNS Topics
- SNS Subscriptions
- IAM Policies

## Deployment

During deployment the Nitric CLI builds your subscribers, then deploys topics and subscriptions:

- Files containing subscriber functions are built into container images
- Built container images are pushed to the [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) as private images
- Functions in [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) are created to run the container images
- Topics are created in SNS
- SNS Subscriptions are created which target the Lambda functions
- IAM permissions are created enabling publishers and subscribers
