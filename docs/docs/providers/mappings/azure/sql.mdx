# Azure Resources - SQL Database

Nitric SQL Databases are deployed to Azure using [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/postgresql).

## Azure Resources

The following resources are created when deploying SQL Databases to Azure:

- Virtual Network
- Subnet
- PostgreSQL Databases
- Container Instance Group for migrations

## Deployment

During deployment the Nitric CLI deploys your SQL Databases:

- Virtual Network and Subnet are created
- Declared databases are deployed as PostgreSQL databases
- Container Group Instances are created to run migrations
- Container Apps are setup to run the containers

## Other Engine Support

Currently, Nitric supports only PostgreSQL for Azure SQL databases. Support for other engines like MySQL is not available yet, but you can create a [custom provider](/providers/custom) to add support for your preferred database engine.

If you'd like to see support for additional engines, please share your [feedback](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/issues/684) with the Nitric team!
