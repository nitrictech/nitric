# Azure Resources - APIs

Nitric APIs are deployed to Azure using [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/).

## Azure Resources

The following resources are created when deploying APIs to Azure:

- API Management Service
- Container Apps
- ACR Images
- Azure Resource Group

## Notes

The resource group stores metadata about the resources.
All metadata is stored in the region nominated by the region which you have configured.

## Deployment

During deployment the Nitric CLI builds your API's routes, methods and handlers will be built as follows:

- Files referenced by the `services` key in the `nitric.yaml` file are built into container images
- Built container images are pushed to the [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/) as private images
- Container Apps are setup to run the containers
- All route/handler mappings are built into an Open API v3 definition file
- The API definition and Resource Group is deployed as an API Management hosted API
