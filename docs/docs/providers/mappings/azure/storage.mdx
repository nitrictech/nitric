# Azure Resources - Storage

Nitric Storage are deployed to Azure using [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/).

## Azure Resources

The following resources are created when deploying Storage to Azure:

- Blob Container
- Azure Resource Group

## Deployment

<Note>
  Note: Azure Storage 'Containers' are synonymous with 'Buckets' in other cloud
  platforms.
</Note>

During deployment the Nitric CLI creates your Storage Containers:

- Each Bucket declaration in your services are deployed as a Blob Container in Azure
- Container Apps are configured to enable access to Storage Containers
