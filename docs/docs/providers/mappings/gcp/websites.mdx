# Google Cloud Resources - Websites

Nitric Websites are deployed to Google Cloud using [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage), [Cloud CDN](https://cloud.google.com/cdn), [Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns), [Cloud Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing) and [Certificate Manager](https://cloud.google.com/certificate-manager).

## Google Cloud Resources

The following resources are created when deploying Websites to Google Cloud:

- Storage Bucket
- Cloud CDN Backends
- Load Balancer Target Https Proxy
- DNS Zone Entries
- A Certificate Manager Certificate

## Deployment

During deployment the Nitric CLI creates a storage bucket for each website, uploading each static asset as an object. Then configures a target https proxy, certificate, and CDN as described to serve those assets:

- A Cloud Storage Bucket, per website
- Cloud CDN to cache and serve static files
- A Cloud Load Balancer to route traffic to buckets and APIs, including URL rewrites
- Cloud DNS to configure a domain name for the Load Balancer
- Certificate Manager to issue a certificate for the Load Balancer, enabling HTTPS
