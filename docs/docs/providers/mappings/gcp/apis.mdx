# Google Cloud Resources - APIs

Nitric APIs are deployed to Google Cloud using [API Gateway](https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway).

## Google Cloud Resources

The following resources are created when deploying APIs to Google Cloud:

- [API Gateway](https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway)
- [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)
- [GCR](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)

## Deployment

During deployment, the Nitric CLI builds your API's routes, methods, and handlers. They are built as follows:

- Files referenced by the `services` key in the `nitric.yaml` file are built into container images
- Built container images are pushed to the [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry) as private images
- Container Images are deployed as Cloud Run services.
- All route/handler mappings are built into an Open API v2 (Swagger) definition file (Google Cloud API Gateway does not support v3).
- Your services will be routed to using Google Clouds Open API Extensions `x-google-backend`.
- The API definition and Resource Group is deployed to API Gateway.
