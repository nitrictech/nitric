# Google Cloud Resources - Secrets

Nitric Secrets are deployed to Google Cloud using [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager).

## Google Cloud Resources

- Secret Manager Secrets (at runtime)
- IAM Policies

## Deployment

Secret Manager is a service offered by Google Cloud, there are no instances to deploy. As a result, the Nitric CLI only ensures the appropriate IAM policies and roles are in place to allow your Cloud Run Functions to access and store secrets.
