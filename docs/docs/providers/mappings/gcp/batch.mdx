# Google Cloud Resources - Batch

Nitric Batch Jobs are deployed to Google Cloud using [Batch](https://cloud.google.com/batch).

## Google Cloud Resources

The following resources are created when deploying Batch Jobs to Google Cloud:

- Google Cloud Batch Compute Environments
- Google Cloud Batch Job Queues
- Google Cloud Batch Job Definitions
- EC2 Instances
- EC2 Security Groups
- ECR Images
- IAM Policies

## Deployment

During deployment the Nitric CLI deploys your batch jobs:

- Built container images are pushed to the [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) as private images
- Files referenced by the `batch-services` key in the `nitric.yaml` file are built into Job Definitions
- IAM policies are created
