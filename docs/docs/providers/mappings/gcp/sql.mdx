# Google Cloud Resources - SQL Database

Nitric SQL Databases are deployed to Google Cloud using [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql).

## Google Cloud Resources

The following resources are created when deploying SQL Databases to Google Cloud:

- Private Network
- Subnet
- PostgreSQL Databases
- Cloud Run Jobs for migrations

## Deployment

During deployment the Nitric CLI deploys your SQL Databases:

- Private Network is created for the Google project
- Subnet is created for the network
- Declared databases are deployed as PostgreSQL databases
- Migration images are built and deployed to the artifact registry
- Migrations are run against the deployed databases using cloud run jobs

## Other Engine Support

Currently, Nitric supports only PostgreSQL for Google Cloud SQL databases. Support for other engines like MySQL is not available yet, but you can create a [custom provider](/providers/custom) to add support for your preferred database engine.

If you'd like to see support for additional engines, please share your [feedback](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/issues/684) with the Nitric team!
