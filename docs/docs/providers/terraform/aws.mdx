# Terraform AWS Provider Overview

_The officially supported Nitric Terraform AWS Provider._

```yaml
provider: nitric/awstf@latest
```

<Note>
  The Nitric Terraform AWS Provider is currently in Preview. We recommend
  reviewing the generated Terraform before deploying to Production environments,
  or alternatively using the [Pulumi AWS Providers](/providers/pulumi/aws).
</Note>

## Prerequisites

The **Terraform CLI** is required to deploy the resulting Terraform Stack that Nitric generates. You can find the installation instructions for Terraform in the [Terraform documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

The provider is built with the [Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF)](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf). Since CDKTF relies on Node.js, you'll need to have Node.js installed, you can read about the full CDKTF prerequisites in the [CDKTF documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cdktf/cdktf-install#prerequisites).

## AWS Credentials

The Terraform CLI typically uses standard AWS credential settings to authenticate with AWS. If you've set credentials for the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK previously, these settings should work without modification.

If you're setting your credentials for the first time, there are several available methods. We recommend the standard AWS credentials file to get started.

### AWS Credential File Setup

Create a new credentials files at one of these locations:

- `~/.aws/credentials` on Linux, macOS, or Unix
- `C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials` on Windows

The file should contain the following:

```toml
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your_access_key_id
aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_access_key
```

<Note>
  To use a different AWS profile for your deployments, you can use the
  `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable. If no profile is supplied, we will use the
  `[default]` profile.
</Note>

Replace `your_access_key_id` and `your_secret_access_key` with your own values.

You can create an Access Key by logging into the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and navigating to:
`Username Menu > Security credentials > Access keys > Create New Access Key`

<Note>
  See [AWS
  documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html)
  for full details on credentials and configuration.
</Note>

## Locating deployed resources

Nitric creates a resource tag manager group and tags all possible resources to be referenced by this group. You can locate resources in the console by going to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)

Next, navigate to the [Resource Groups service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/resource-groups/home):

![resource group search image](/docs/images/docs/aws-rg.png)

Find your stack's resource group in the list and click it:

<Note>
  Resource groups are conventionally named `<project-name>-<stack-name>`

In this example the project name is `api-testing` and the stack name is `aws`.

</Note>

## Importing Existing Resources

The Nitric team is working to expand the list of resources that can be imported. Currently, only the following resources are supported:

- [Secrets](/secrets)

<Note>
  Currently, only resources in the same AWS account and region as the Nitric project 
  are supported.
</Note>

### Secrets

To import a secret, you will need to know the secret's ARN. You can find the ARN of a secret in the AWS console or by using the AWS CLI.

First, add the secret to your project as you usually would if it wasn't imported. Then add the secret to the `import` section of your stack file. Here's an example of how to import a secret:

```javascript
import { secret } from "@nitric/sdk

const mySecret = secret("credentials").allow("access");
```

```yaml
import:
  secrets:
    credentials: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:my-secret
```

<Note>
  Unlike some other imported resources, secret imports require the ARN to be used. 
  Providing only the secret's name will be invalid.
</Note>

# Import existing AWS Resources
# Currently only secrets are supported
import:
  # A name ARN map of secrets, where the name matches the nitric name of the secret you would like to import
  secrets:
    # In typescript this would import the provided secret reference for a secret declared as
    # const mySecret = secret('my-secret');
    my-secret: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:my-secret

# The timezone that deployed schedules will run with
# Format is in tz identifiers:

# Apply configuration to nitric APIs
apis:
  # The nitric name of the API to configure
  my-api:
