# Nitric Pulumi Providers

Nitric enables application portability and deployments through pluggable modules known as [providers](/get-started/foundations/deployment#providers). This allows applications to be deployed with many different Infrastructure Automation technologies, including [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com). Nitric has pre-built providers that use Pulumi to deploy to [AWS](/providers/pulumi/aws), [Azure](/providers/pulumi/azure) and [Google Cloud](/providers/pulumi/gcp).

<Note>
  All pre-built Pulumi providers are [direct deployment
  providers](/get-started/foundations/deployment#providers).
</Note>

These providers are recommended if you're new to Nitric. Pulumi's [Automation API](https://www.pulumi.com/automation/) lets Nitric define and deploy infrastructure directly, without transpiling to another DSL first. This reduces the steps and tooling needed for deployments.

<Note>
  If you have a specific need to use another IfC tool, such as Terraform, those
  providers are [also available](/providers/terraform) or you can [build your
  own](/providers/custom).
</Note>

## Prerequisites

The **Pulumi CLI** is required to deploy Nitric applications using the Pulumi Providers. You can find the installation instructions in the [Pulumi documentation](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install/).

## Available Pulumi Providers

- [AWS](/providers/pulumi/aws)
- [Azure](/providers/pulumi/azure)
- [Google Cloud](/providers/pulumi/gcp)

## How Nitric integrates with Pulumi

Nitric uses the [Pulumi Automation API](https://www.pulumi.com/automation/) for its pre-built Pulumi Providers. This means there's no need to create a workspace to manage stacks alongside your project. Instead, the Provider interacts directly with Pulumi via the Automation API to manage stacks.

This does not change how you integrate Nitric with Pulumi Cloud if you wish to use it as a [state backend](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/concepts/state-and-backends/) for your stacks.

## Using your Pulumi Cloud Account (Optional)

If you need to login to your Pulumi Cloud account you can do so with:

```bash
pulumi login
```

Once you're logged in, you can deploy your Nitric project using the Nitric CLI:

```bash
nitric up
```

Within your project directory and wait until the project has finished deploying. You can also follow your deployment on the [Pulumi Cloud dashboard](https://app.pulumi.com)
