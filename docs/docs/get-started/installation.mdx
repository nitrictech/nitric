# Installation

## Prerequisites

Nitric relies on functionality from the following projects to help retrieve plugins, containerize, and deploy your application.
Please follow these links to the official installation steps for each.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx/)

### Deployment Prerequisites

Deployment plugins have their own requirements, please refer to the documentation for the specific deployment provider you want to use.

- [Pulumi Providers](/providers/pulumi#prerequisites)
- [Terraform Providers](/providers/terraform#prerequisites)

<Note>
  When setting up Docker on Linux be sure to follow the [post-installation
  steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) so you can
  run Docker as a non-root user.
